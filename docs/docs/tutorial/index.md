# Slicknode GraphQL Tutorial

## Introduction

This is a step by step tutorial to guide you through the process of building a production-ready GraphQL API
for a real world application using Slicknode. Afterwards you will have a thorough understanding of how
to build complex applications while using all the major concepts like authorization, authentication,
data modeling and creating your own extensions with TypeScript etc.

## Required Knowledge

A design goal of Slicknode is to reduce the amount of knowledge that is required to build things, therefore it is very easy even for beginners to build complex solutions and a lot of things are self explanatory. You should have a basic familiarity with the following:

- A very basic understanding of GraphQL. If you don't know GraphQL yet, briefly check out [the official documentation](https://graphql.org/learn).
- You should be comfortable using the command line.

Advanced developers can skip the sections with the detailed explanations and just follow the instructions.
